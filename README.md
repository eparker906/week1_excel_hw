# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze how the outcomes of theater related kickstarters were impacted by Launch date and the financial goal set.

## Analysis and Challenges

Pivot tables, and functions were used to analyze the data data for both deliverables.  Pivot table and Countifs function has some challenges if getting the analysis to look (close) to the same as the examples in the module

### Analysis and Results of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To assess how the launch date effected the outcomes of the kickstarter campaigns, I used the Year() function to parse the year from each campaign to asses what time of the year were most successful do a campaign. The spring and summer months are the best time to raise money in Kickstarter.

### Analysis and Results of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis assessed how the initial monetary goal effected the campaign outcomes. The most successful goal range was $1000 or less, the next successfull range was $40k - $45K.
